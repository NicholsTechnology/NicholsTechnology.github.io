<h2>New-Old Job</h2>

# News
After months and months of waiting, and barely working in the fast food industry, I have finally received an opportunity to return to my glorious job at Walmart!! But even better, 
I will be working as an Entertainment TA, which is back in Electronics!!! This may not seem like the greatest thing in the world, but 
after leaving my job previously, I realized how valuable a stable income was. Especially in this day and age.  So now I am more determined than 
ever to make sure I keep moving forward, maybe even advancing my career with Walmart.

# TLDR:
Working in Electronics at my local Walmart after a terrible job in fast food.
